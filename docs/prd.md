# Product Requirement Document: Facility Reservation System

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-06-14  
**Author**: Tomochika Hara
**Status**: Draft

---

## Executive Summary

The Facility Reservation System is a lightweight, API-first platform designed to solve the chaos of shared space management in organizations. Unlike bloated enterprise solutions or inadequate calendar-based workarounds, our system provides a focused, cost-effective solution for organizations that need reliable facility booking without vendor lock-in.

**Current State**: Foundation complete with user/facility management and robust API architecture  
**Target State**: Complete reservation platform with real-time booking, conflict resolution, and analytics  

### Key Value Propositions
- **Simplicity over complexity**: Focused on core booking workflows, not feature bloat
- **API-first architecture**: Enables custom integrations and client applications
- **Cost-effective**: Self-hosted alternative to expensive enterprise solutions
- **Developer-friendly**: Type-safe APIs with auto-generated client SDKs

---

## Problem Statement

### The Booking Chaos Problem

Organizations with shared facilities face a persistent set of problems that existing solutions fail to address adequately:

**Current Pain Points:**
1. **Double Bookings**: Without centralized visibility, conflicts are discovered too late
2. **Booking Friction**: Complex enterprise tools discourage usage, leading to informal "desk camping"
3. **No Visibility**: Can't see what's available, when, or who's using what
4. **Manual Overhead**: Administrative burden of managing bookings, resolving conflicts
5. **Poor User Experience**: Clunky interfaces that don't match how people actually work
6. **Cost Prohibitive**: Enterprise solutions cost more than the problem they solve for smaller organizations

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Solution Type | Problems |
|---------------|----------|
| **Google Calendar/Outlook** | No conflict prevention, poor facility metadata, calendar spam |
| **Enterprise Software** | Expensive, complex, vendor lock-in, over-engineered |
| **Spreadsheets/Manual** | No conflict detection, poor user experience, administrative overhead |
| **Physical Sign-ups** | No advance planning, information silos, no analytics |

### Target Organization Profile

Organizations that would benefit most:
- **50-500 employees** (too big for manual, too small for enterprise solutions)
- **Multiple shared spaces** (meeting rooms, equipment, common areas)
- **Cost-conscious** (need ROI justification for tools)
- **Tech-savvy enough** to appreciate API-first approach
- **Growth-oriented** (need scalable solutions)
