# Design Documents

This directory contains design documents for complex systems and workflows in the Facility Reservation System.

## Design Doc Index

| Number | Title | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| [001](001-code-generation-pipeline.md) | Code Generation Pipeline | Active |
| [002](002-api-contract-ecosystem.md) | API Contract Ecosystem | Active |
| [003](003-development-workflow.md) | Development Workflow | Active |

## What is a Design Doc?

Design documents explain how complex systems work and provide implementation guidance. Unlike ADRs which document specific decisions, design docs cover entire features or workflows.

Each design doc typically includes:
- **Goals and Non-Goals**: What the system should and shouldn't do
- **Overview**: High-level system description
- **Detailed Design**: Implementation specifics
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other approaches and why they weren't chosen
- **Testing Plan**: How to verify the system works correctly

## Design Doc Format

We use a modified Google-style design doc template:

```markdown
# [Number]. [Title]

**Author**: [Name]  
**Status**: [Draft | Active | Deprecated]  
**Last Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Goals

[What this system should accomplish]

## Non-Goals

[What this system explicitly does NOT do]

## Overview

[High-level description of the system]

## Detailed Design

[Implementation specifics, diagrams, code examples]

## Alternatives Considered

[Other approaches and why they weren't chosen]

## Testing Strategy

[How to verify the system works]

## Future Considerations

[Known limitations and potential improvements]
```

## Creating a New Design Doc

1. Copy the template format above
2. Use the next sequential number (001, 002, etc.)
3. Write a clear, descriptive title
4. Start with status "Draft"
5. Get feedback from the team
6. Change to "Active" once agreed upon

## Principles

- **Focus on complex systems**: Only document things that need explanation
- **Living documents**: Update as systems evolve
- **Implementation guidance**: Provide enough detail for implementation
- **Honest about tradeoffs**: Document alternatives and their pros/cons
- **Visual aids**: Use diagrams and code examples liberally
